No red rose on your grave, you poor sucker
One by one, all these bloodhounds keep coming
Sleep in the casket you made, you're gone, sucker
But you're mad if you thought I'd let you go
No

Get the fuck outta' my head
So long, sucker
I don't wanna see you, I hate this life
Get your fingers out of my hair
You're gone, sucker
Good luck killing me 'cause I'm already, already
Dead Inside

Dirty little animals, you cannibals, eat your supper
One by one, all these vultures keep coming
Pretty little lamb, don't come down here, you're gone sucker
But you're mad if you thoug\ht I'd let you go (haha)

Get the fuck outta my head
So long, sucker
I don't wanna see you, I hate this life
Get your fingers out of my hair
You're gone, sucker
Good luck killing me 'cause I'm already, already

Get the fuck outta my head
So long, sucker
I don't wanna see you, I hate this life
Get your fingers out of my hair
You're gone, sucker
Good luck killing me 'cause I'm already, already

Dead inside
Get your fingers out of my hair
You're gone, sucker
Good luck killing me 'cause I'm already, already
Dead inside
